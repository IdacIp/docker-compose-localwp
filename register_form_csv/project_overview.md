Conceptual Overview
1. Post the registration form template (HTML) to WordPress. [Already done in demo_register_form]
2. Form Submission Handling (WordPress): When the user submits the form on your WordPress page, you need a way to process that submission. This typically involves JavaScript code running on the page.
3. Data Transmission: The JavaScript code will collect the form data and send it to a specific URL.
4. Receive Data (Python): Your Python script needs to act as a receiver for this data. This requires setting up a basic web server with a specific endpoint that listens for incoming POST requests. Flask is the easiest way to do this.
5. Data Processing and Storage (Python): Once the Python script receives the data, it extracts the relevant information and appends it to your CSV file.
